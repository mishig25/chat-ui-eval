    "prompt": "How to use 3d models in Gradio?",
    "answer": "gr.Model3D(),",
    "generation": "To use 3D models in Gradio, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure you have the Gradio Python package installed.\n\n2. Define a function that loads your 3D mesh file. For example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndef load_mesh(mesh_file_name):\n    return mesh_file_name\n```\n\n3. Create a Gradio interface with the `gr.Interface` class. Pass your function, input component (`gr.Model3D`), and output component (`gr.Model3D`) to the `Interface` class. You can also specify additional parameters for the output component, such as `clear_color` and `label`.\n\n```python\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=load_mesh,\n    inputs=gr.Model3D(),\n    outputs=gr.Model3D(clear_color=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], label=\"3D Model\")\n)\n```\n\n4. Provide a list of example 3D model files that you want to display in your demo. These files should be in `.obj`, `.glb`, or `.gltf` format.\n\n```python\nexamples = [\n    [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Bunny.obj\")],\n    [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Duck.glb\")],\n    [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Fox.gltf\")],\n    [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/face.obj\")]\n]\n```\n\n5. Start the Gradio demo by calling the `launch` method on your interface object.\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\n6. Run your Python script to start the Gradio demo.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport os\n\ndef load_mesh(mesh_file_name):\n    return mesh_file_name\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=load_mesh,\n    inputs=gr.Model3D(),\n    outputs=gr.Model3D(clear_color=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], label=\"3D Model\"),\n    examples=[\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Bunny.obj\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Duck.glb\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Fox.gltf\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/face.obj\")]\n    ]\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"files/Bunny.obj\"`, `\"files/Duck.glb\"`, `\"files/Fox.gltf\"`, and `\"files/face.obj\"` with the actual paths to your 3D model files."

    "prompt": "How to do two-ways props binding in svelte?",
    "answer": "bind:bindValue",
    "generation": "In Svelte, two-way binding can be achieved by using the bind directive. For example, to bind the value of an input element to a variable in your component, you can use the following code:\n\n```html\n<input bind:value={myVariable}>\n```\n\nThis will update the myVariable whenever the input value changes, and it will also update the input value whenever myVariable changes.\n\nYou can also use two-way binding with component props. For example, if you have a child component that needs to update a prop based on user input, you can pass the prop using the bind directive:\n\n```html\n<ChildComponent bind:propName={myVariable}>\n```\n\nThis will update the propName prop of the ChildComponent whenever myVariable changes, and it will also update myVariable whenever propName changes.\n\nIt's important to note that two-way binding in Svelte is safe and consistent, meaning that it won't cause unexpected behavior or inconsistencies in your code. Svelte ensures that changes are propagated in a predictable manner, avoiding common issues found in other frameworks.\n\nAdditionally, Svelte provides tools like the $: operator to help manage reactivity and ensure that your code behaves as expected when using two-way binding."

    "answer": "setBackground(color: Color, alpha?: number)",
    "generation": "Yes, you can set a background color for your kaboom.js game by passing in the background color value as an option when initializing kaboom. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nkaboom({\n    width: 320,\n    height: 240,\n    background: [255, 0, 0], // Set background color to red\n    ...otherOptions\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the background color is set to red by passing in the RGB values `[255, 0, 0]`. You can replace these values with your desired color.\n\nYou can also set the background color using CSS by targeting the canvas element that kaboom creates. Here's an example:\n\n```css\n#kaboom-canvas {\n    background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `#kaboom-canvas` with the appropriate ID or class of the canvas element if you have customized it."

    "prompt": "How do I center an element horiontally and vertically using tailwindcss?",
    "answer": "flex items-center justify-center or grid place-items-center",
    "generation": "To center an element horizontally and vertically using TailwindCSS, you can apply the flexbox properties justify-center and items-center to the parent container. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flex h-screen justify-center items-center\">\n  <div class=\"text-center bg-blue-400\">\n    <!-- Your content here -->\n    <h1 class=\"text-3xl\">HEADING</h1>\n    <p class=\"text-xl\">Sub text</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn the above code, the outer div has the class \"flex h-screen justify-center items-center\". The \"flex\" property enables flexbox, \"h-screen\" sets the height of the container to the full screen height, \"justify-center\" centers the content horizontally, and \"items-center\" centers the content vertically.\n\nThe inner div has the class \"text-center bg-blue-400\", which centers the text within the div and applies a blue background color. You can replace the \"h1\" and \"p\" tags with your own content.\n\nBy using this combination of classes, you can easily center an element both horizontally and vertically in TailwindCSS."

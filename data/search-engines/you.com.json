    "prompt": "What are good ski resorts in France?",
    "answer": "Need to mention Chamonix at least",
    "generation": "Here are ten fantastic French resorts which should be on the radar of anyone dreaming of their future ski holidays. Contents Chamonix Huddling in the shadow of the Mont Blanc massif, Chamonix is one of the most famous ski resorts in France, known for its brilliant glacier skiing and the wide range of terrain - hardly surprising given its proximity to the mountain used for the World Cup downhill races. But there's much more than just adrenaline-pumping thrills here; gentle groomed slopes provide plenty of space for beginners or intermediates who want to improve their skills without feeling overwhelmed by speed demons whizzing past at breakneck speeds! And when you need a break from skiing, take a ride up Le Brevent cable car for stunning views across town. Meribel One of several resorts located within France's massive Trois Vallées ski area (others include Courchevel and Val Thorens), Meribel was founded back in 1938 by British Colonel Peter Lindsay – whose family still owns properties around town today! It's easy to see why he fell in love with this place: tree-lined runs cut through beautiful evergreen forests, while chalets made from traditional wood add warmth and character that feels authentic rather than tacky or touristy. Plus, if you time your visit right during peak season weeks such as Christmas week or New Year's Eve celebrations, expect festive fun including live music performances and fireworks displays lighting up the night sky above! Les Gets, France One of the best ski resorts in France, the small and picturesque village of Les Gets started life as a dairy farming village in the 12th century. The ski resort still retains a rustic charm that sets it apart from the larger purpose-built resorts nearby. There are 650km of pistes to choose from in the Portes du Soliel ski area, with something for every level of skier - from beginner zones near the village center to challenging black diamond runs higher up. And don't miss trying out their famous 'Igloo Village', where you can sleep inside an ice hotel complete with bar & restaurant! Alpe d'Huez This popular ski destination first opened way back in 1936, making it one of the oldest winter sports spots in France. Its sunny location means conditions tend to suit cruising rather than tricky maneuvers; think big sweeping turns instead of tight switchbacks or hairpin bends. With 250 kilometers worth of trails spread across four different sectors, there's enough variety here to keep even expert skiers entertained for days on end. For families traveling together, look into renting equipment at one of many local shops offering discounts for children under eight years old. Morzine Located just a short drive from Geneva Airport, Morzine provides quick access to Avoriaz, part of another huge ski domain called les Portes du Soleil. Unlike neighboring Les Gets, though, Morzine itself doesn't actually have any ski lifts running directly out of town – so beginners might feel more comfortable basing themselves elsewhere unless they plan on taking lessons straight away. That said, advanced riders will appreciate having easy access to Avoriaz via bus service or taxi cab; plus, cross country enthusiasts will enjoy exploring surrounding countryside paths leading towards Seythenex or Champéry. Megève Another classic French ski resort town, Megève began attracting visitors way back in the early 20th century thanks largely to Baroness Noémie de Rothschild opening her chalet here in 1911 (which later became Hôtel du Tremplin). Today, its cobblestone streets lined with upscale boutiques make clear that money still flows freely through these parts – especially around peak seasons like February half term holidays or Christmas breaks. Thankfully, affordable options exist too, whether booking self-catering accommodation outside central areas or simply enjoying activities like dog sledding excursions or horse drawn sleigh rides through forest trails instead of splurging on pricey lift passes. Peisey-Vallandry A hidden gem tucked away deep within les Trois Vallées ski region alongside better-known names like Courchevel and Mottaret, Peisey-Vallandry makes a great base for mixed ability groups due to its diverse selection of slopes suitable for everyone from nervous novices to veteran freeriders. Beginners benefit from tranquil nursery slopes situated close to several convenient restaurants serving food"

    "prompt": "What is diffusers AI?",
    "answer": "It is a hugging face library for working with diffusion models",
    "generation": "Sure, here's a possible answer:\n\nDiffusers AI refers to a type of generative artificial intelligence called diffusion models. These models are capable of generating various types of data, including images, videos, music, and text. They have been increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to create realistic and diverse outputs. In particular, diffusion models have shown impressive results in text-to-image synthesis, where they can generate detailed images based on textual descriptions.\n\nOne notable example of a diffusion model is the DALL-E model, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in various benchmarks. Other examples include Imagen and DreamBooth. These models have been applied in various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and digital art. However, it's important to note that diffusion models still have limitations and challenges, such as mode collapse and lack of interpretability. Therefore, further research is needed to overcome these issues and fully realize the potential of diffusion models."

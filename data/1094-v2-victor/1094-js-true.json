    "prompt": "How to use 3d models in Gradio?",
    "answer": "gr.Model3D(),",
    "generation": "To use 3D models in Gradio, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the Gradio Python package if you haven't already.\n2. Define a function that loads your 3D mesh file. In the example code provided, the function is called `load_mesh`, and it takes a mesh file name as input and returns the mesh file.\n3. Create a Gradio interface by calling `gr.Interface()`. Pass your `load_mesh` function as the `fn` argument.\n4. Set the `inputs` argument of the `gr.Interface()` function to `gr.Model3D()`. This specifies that the input to your function is a 3D model.\n5. Set the `outputs` argument of the `gr.Interface()` function to `gr.Model3D()`, with optional arguments such as `clear_color` and `label`. This specifies that the output of your function is also a 3D model.\n6. Provide a list of example 3D model files using the `examples` argument. Each item in the list should be a list containing the path to the 3D model file.\n7. Call the `launch()` method on your Gradio interface to start the demo.\n\nHere's the complete code snippet based on the information provided:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\nimport os\n\ndef load_mesh(mesh_file_name):\n    return mesh_file_name\n\ndemo = gr.Interface(\n    fn=load_mesh,\n    inputs=gr.Model3D(),\n    outputs=gr.Model3D(\n        clear_color=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        label=\"3D Model\"\n    ),\n    examples=[\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Bunny.obj\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Duck.glb\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/Fox.gltf\")],\n        [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"files/face.obj\")]\n    ]\n)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demo.launch()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `\"files/Bunny.obj\"`, `\"files/Duck.glb\"`, `\"files/Fox.gltf\"`, and `\"files/face.obj\"` with the actual paths to your 3D model files.\n\nWith this code, you can run your Gradio demo and interact with 3D models."

    "prompt": "How to do two-ways props binding in svelte?",
    "answer": "bind:bindValue",
    "generation": "In Svelte, two-way binding can be achieved by using the bind directive. For example, to bind the value of an input element to a variable in your component, you can use the following code:\n\n```html\n<input bind:value={myVariable}>\n```\n\nThis will create a two-way binding between the input element's value and the myVariable property in your component. Any changes made to the input element's value will automatically update the myVariable property, and vice versa.\n\nYou can also use two-way binding with component props. For example, if you have a child component that needs to receive a value from its parent component, you can use the bind directive to achieve this. Here's an example:\n\nParent component:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  let value = 'initial value';\n</script>\n\n<Child bind:value={value} />\n```\n\nChild component:\n\n```html\n<script>\n  export let value;\n</script>\n\n<input bind:value={value}>\n```\n\nIn this example, the value prop in the Child component is bound to the value property in the Parent component. Any changes made to the input element in the Child component will automatically update the value property in the Parent component, and vice versa.\n\nIt's important to note that two-way binding in Svelte is not limited to just input elements or props. You can use the bind directive to create two-way bindings between any compatible values, such as class names, styles, or even custom component properties."

Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nkaboom({\n    background: [255, 0, 0], // sets the background color to red\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the background color is set to red by specifying the RGB values [255, 0, 0]. You can replace these values with your desired color.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to dynamically change the background color during gameplay, you can use the `background` function provided by kaboom.js. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\n// inside your game logic\nbackground([0, 255, 0]) // changes the background color to green\n```\n\nBy calling the `background` function with the desired color values, you can change the background color at any point in your game."

It will now be centered both horizontally and vertically within the parent container, which itself is centered on the screen.\n\nYou can adjust the height of the parent container by changing the `h-screen` class to another height utility class or a custom height value."
